Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-Using-Python-SQL-PowerBI
## Objective
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover business insights. The goal is to understand revenue trends, customer segments, discount usage, and subscription patterns through end-to-end analytics.

## Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to understand customer behavior due to scattered data, inconsistent records, and a lack of structured analysis. This project aims to transform raw customer transaction data into meaningful insights that support better marketing, sales, and decision-making strategies.

### Features
## Data Analysis & SQL Operations
Performed advanced SQL analysis to answer business questions such as:
- Revenue comparison by gender
- Top-rated products by average rating
- Discount impact on purchase behavior
- Subscriber vs non-subscriber spending behavior
- Customer segmentation based on purchase history
- Revenue contribution by age group

## Data Cleaning & Processing
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant fields
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Optimized numeric and categorical variables
- Created structured data for analysis in Python and SQL

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Outlier detection and distribution analysis
- Trend identification using visualizations
- Customer behavior pattern analysis

## Key Insights Derived
- Subscribed customers spend more on average than non-subscribed customers
- Express shipping customers tend to make higher-value purchases
- Certain products receive consistently higher customer ratings
- Discount usage varies significantly across product categories
- Loyal customers generate higher overall revenue
- Younger and middle-aged groups form the largest revenue contributors
